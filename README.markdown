Stylebot
-----------

A Chrome/Chromium extension to allow users to adapt the web's appearance to their preference by creating custom CSS. It aims to improve the accessibility and adaptability of the web, both for users who're not familiar with CSS and advanced CSS users.

Using Stylebot, users will be able to:

1. Incrementally build the custom stylesheet for Chrome.
2. Save custom CSS rules for a site / group of sites, so that the next time they visit it, their custom CSS is already applied.

Installation
--------------

Download `stylebot.crx` and open it in Chrome / Chromium. Or, you can also load `/stylebot` as an unpacked extension (in Developer mode).

Once installed, you can toggle stylebot on a page by either clicking on the 'css' icon in omnibar or pressing 'ctrl + e'.
